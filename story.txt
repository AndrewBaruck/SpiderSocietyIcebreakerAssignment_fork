There once was a jester put up in an Eltz.
He went to the baeckerei and got some brot to eat.
For dessert, he had some apfelkuchen.
Then he unsteadily walked into his porsche, gleefully laughing as he eratically drove away.
The jester went on a hike throughout Berlin.
The jester made sure to don their Lederhose beforehand.
